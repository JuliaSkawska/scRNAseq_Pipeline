# scRNAseq analysis pipeline
*Note: This project is still under construction*

## Overview:
This project aims to provide tools for processing and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data obtained from 10x Genomics technology.<br/>
The provided scripts are intended to facilitate and semi-automate tasks involved in scRNA-seq with minimal user input ( user interface to be added )

## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.
- Install the required dependencies ( scanpy, anndata, pandas )

## Usage
- converting 10x Genomics data into AnnData
- retriving and returing basic information about AnnData files
- filtering AnnData
